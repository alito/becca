    One-dimensional grid task, multi-step

    In this task, the agent steps forward and backward along a
    line. The fourth position is rewarded (+1/2) and the ninth
    position is punished (-1/2).

    This is intended to be as similar as possible to the 
    one-dimensional grid task, but require multi-step planning for optimal 
    behavior.

    Optimal performance is between 0.25 and 0.3 reward per time step.
