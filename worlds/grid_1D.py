    One-dimensional grid task

    In this task, the agent steps forward and backward along a
    nine-position line. The fourth position is rewarded (+1/2) and the ninth
    position is punished (-1/2). There is also a slight punishment
    for effort expended in trying to move, i.e. taking actions.
    
    This is intended to be a simple-as-possible task for
    troubleshooting BECCA.
    
    The theoretically optimal performance without exploration is 0.5 
    reward per time step.
    In practice, the best performance the algorithm can achieve with the 
    exploration levels given is around 0.35 reward per time step.
