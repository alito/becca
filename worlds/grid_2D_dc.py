    """ grid_2D_dc.World,  Two-dimensional grid task
    DC stands for decoupled. It's just like the task_grid_2D task except that 
    the two dimensions are decoupled. The basic feature vector represents a
    row and a column separately, not coupled together.
    In this task, the agent steps North, South, East, or West in a
    5 x 5 grid-world. Position (4,4) is rewarded and (2,2) is
    punished.  There is also a lesser penalty of for each horizontal
    or vertical step taken. Horizonal and vertical positions are reported
    separately as basic features, rather than raw sensory inputs.
    This is intended to be a simple-as-possible-but-slightly-more-interesting-
    that-the-one-dimensional-task task for troubleshooting BECCA.
     Optimal performance is a reward of between 70 and 80 per time step.
