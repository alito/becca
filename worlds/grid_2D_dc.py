    Two-dimensional grid task

    dc stands for decoupled. It's just like the task_grid_2D task except that 
    the two dimensions are decoupled. The basic feature vector represents a
    row and a column separately, not coupled together.

    In this task, the agent steps North, South, East, or West in a
    5 x 5 grid-world. Position (4,4) is rewarded (1/2) and (2,2) is
    punished (-1/2).  There is also a penalty of -1/20 for each horizontal
    or vertical step taken. Horizonal and vertical positions are reported
    separately as basic features, rather than raw sensory inputs.

    This is intended to be a
    simple-as-possible-but-slightly-more-interesting-
    that-the-one-dimensional-task task for troubleshooting BECCA.

    Optimal performance is between 0.3 and 0.35.
