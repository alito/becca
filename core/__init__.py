"""
The core BECCA code

This package contains all the learning algorithms and heuristics 
implemented together in a functional learning agent. Most users 
won't need to modify anything in this package. Only core developers,
those who want to experiment with and improve the underlying
learning algorithms and their implementations, should need to muck
around with it.

See tester.py for an example of how to implement it with a world.
