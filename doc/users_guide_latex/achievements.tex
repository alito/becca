\chapter{Publications and hacks}

The number one goal in creating \textsc{Becca} is to help machines do cool stuff. This section is a listing of some of those achievements. Please help me keep this list as complete as possible. If you don't see someone here who should be, add them or let me know. These are organized by name, with each contributor's work in reverse chronological order, and contributors listed in reverse chronological order of their most recent citation.

For using \textsc{Becca} to do something cool and possibly publishing it:

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline
Nick &2012& For integrating \textsc{Becca} 0.3.10 with a Barrett WAM\\
Malone&& arm, driving it to reach goal positions, and for \\
 && publishing the results in papers \\
 && at ICRA~\cite{malone12b} and IROS.~\cite{malone12a}\\
\hline
Aleksandra & 2012 & For searching for a target location in a simulated\\
Faust&& world using both visual and auditory data.\\
&2012& For contributing to a paper at IROS.~\cite{malone12a}\\
&2012& For a review of RL approaches \\
&&that discusses \textsc{Becca}.~\cite{faust12}\\
\hline
SeH & 2012 & For driving a Critterdroid simulation in Java through \\
&&a TCP/IP socket~\cite{seh12a} and for publishing videos \\
&&of the results.~\cite{seh12b,seh12c,seh12d,seh12e} \\
\hline
 \end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline
Matt & 2012 & For integrating \textsc{Becca} (0.3.11 under Octave,\\
Chapman&& slightly modified) with a Lego NXT robot via \\
&&ROS to run the 1D grid task.~\cite{chapman12a}\\
& 2012 & For presenting \textsc{Becca}/ROS/Lego NXT \\
&&integration work to the LA Robotics Club.~\cite{chapman12b}\\
\hline
Brandon & 2012 & For publishing a series of conference papers  \\
Rohrer & and & describing \textsc{Becca}'s development and \\
& earlier & use in a number of simulations and physical \\
&& robot systems.\\
