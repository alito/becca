\chapter{Publications and hacks}

The number one goal in creating \textsc{Becca} is to help machines do cool stuff. This section is a listing of some of those achievements. Please help me keep this list as complete as possible. If you don't see someone here who should be, add them or let me know. These are organized by name, with each contributor's work in reverse chronological order, and contributors listed in reverse chronological order of their most recent citation.

For using \textsc{Becca} to do something cool and possibly publishing it:

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
