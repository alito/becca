\chapter{Project contributions}

\textsc{Becca} is still pretty young, but already several people have put in a lot of effort to develop it. This is an attempt to recognize some of those contributions. Please help me keep this list as complete as possible. If you don't see someone here who should be, add them or let me know. These are organized by name, with each contributor's work in reverse chronological order, and contributors listed in reverse chronological order of their most recent citation.

For time, consideration, and code given to the \textsc{Becca} project:
