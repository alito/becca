class Model(object):
    """ Contains the agent's model of transitions between states.
    The agent uses this to make predictions about what is likely
    to happen next. The ability to predict allows the agent to 
    foresee likely consequences of action it might take, helping
    it to choose good action. It can also contribute to the agent's
    attention processes by tagging feature activity patterns that 
    are unexpected.
    
    The model consists of a table of transitions. A transition
    describes an episode of the agent's experience. It mimics 
    the structure "In situation A, B happened, then C." Each 
    transision consists of four states and four scalars: 
    
    context: This state is a combination of several earlier
            attended features, each decayed according to its age
        
    cause: This state is the the attended feature that immediately
            preceded the effect. 
            
    effect: This state is the predicted result, given the context and the 
            cause. It can be a probability distribution over 
            multiple features.
            
    effect_uncertainty: This state is the expected difference
            between transition effect and the observed effect.
            
    count: This scalar tracks the number of times the transision has
            been observed, and decays slowly with time.
            It is used to represent the usefulness of
            the transition. At intervals, transitions with too low a 
            count are removed from the model.
            
    reward_value: This scalar is the expected reward, given the context
            and the cause.
            
    reward_uncertainty: This scalar is the expected difference
            between the expected reward_value and the observed reward_value.
            
    goal_value: This scalar is an internally-assigned reward value. It 
            is used during planning to prioritize intermediate 
            transisions that may have low inherent reward_value, but
            are likely to lead to rewarding transitions.
            
    Note that all attended features may be either primitives, 
    action, or higher-level features. Thus a context-cause-effect
    transition may be interpreted as state-action-state (a common
    representation in reinforcement learning methods), 
    state-state-action (a useful representation in action selection
    for planning), or state-state-state (a useful representation
    for prediction and modeling) depending on the composition
    of the cause and effect.
    
    Even though the context, cause, and effect of each transision
    are states, the operations that the model must perform are much more
    efficient if the model uses its own state-set representation, 
    rather than making an array of State objects. It allows optimized matrix
    operations, rather than for loops.
